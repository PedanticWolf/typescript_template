# What is this

A skeleton of a basic node project!

0. Update package.json with new name (if desired - if a playground, who cares)
1. Run `npm install`
    - Stock dependencies include typescript and jest (and the supporting packages)
2. Run tests via `npm test`
    - Should see my 1 template test pass
3. Build project `npx tsc`
    - Should see the `./build` dir get generated
4. Run placeholder via `node ./build/index.js`
    - Should see the basic hello world output
5. In VSCode, verify can run
    - Select Run + Debug tab
    - Swap between main program and tests
    - Run each
6. Begin coding in earnest!
